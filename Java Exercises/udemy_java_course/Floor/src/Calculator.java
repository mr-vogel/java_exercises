/*
3. Write a class with the name Calculator. The class needs two fields (instance variables) with name floor of type Floor and carpet of type Carpet.

The class needs to have one constructor with parameters floor of type Floor and carpet of type Carpet and it needs to initialize the fields.

Write the following methods (instance methods):

* Method named getTotalCost without any parameters, it needs to return the calculated total cost to cover the floor with a carpet.


TEST EXAMPLE

→ TEST CODE:

Carpet carpet = new Carpet(3.5);
Floor floor = new Floor(2.75, 4.0);
Calculator calculator = new Calculator(floor, carpet);
System.out.println("total= " + calculator.getTotalCost());
carpet = new Carpet(1.5);
floor = new Floor(5.4, 4.5);
calculator = new Calculator(floor, carpet);
System.out.println("total= " + calculator.getTotalCost());

→ OUTPUT

total= 38.5
total= 36.45


NOTE: All methods should be defined as public NOT public static.

NOTE: In total, you have to write 3 classes.

NOTE: Do not add a main method to the solution code.
