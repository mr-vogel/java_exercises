/*
	    // Challenge.
        // Start with a base class of a Vehicle, then create a Car class that inherits from this base class.
        // Finally, create another class, a specific type of Car that inherits from the Car class.
        // You should be able to hand steering, changing gears, and moving (speed in other words).
        // You will want to decide where to put the appropriate state and behaviours (fields and methods).
        // As mentioned above, changing gears, increasing/decreasing speed should be included.
        // For you specific type of vehicle you will want to add something specific for that type of car.
